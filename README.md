# SleepAdvisory: Enhancing Workforce Health and Performance

## Inspiration
Sleep is a fundamental aspect of our well-being, and its significance cannot be overstated. Workers in labor-intensive industries, such as construction, are often faced with the challenge of managing their sleep and work schedules, which can significantly impact their overall health, productivity, and safety. The inspiration behind SleepAdvisory comes from the desire to address the critical issue of fatigue in the workplace by leveraging cutting-edge technology to create a safer and more efficient work environment.

## What it does
SleepAdvisory is a pioneering facial recognition software that goes beyond the norm to detect fatigue in individuals. It utilizes state-of-the-art AI to not only determine the cause of fatigue but also to offer actionable insights to employers, with the ultimate aim of improving the overall health, safety, and productivity of their workforce.

### Core Functionalities
- **Facial Recognition**: SleepAdvisory employs OpenCV and DLib for facial recognition, analyzing subtle biomechanic parameters to assess fatigue levels accurately.

- **Data Analysis**: Users input their daily data, including sleep hours, work hours, and self-reported tiredness (Yes/No). SleepAdvisory uses AI algorithms to correlate this data and draw insights.

- **Employer Insights**: The software aggregates data from all employees, providing construction employers with a holistic view of their workforce's well-being. Employers can make informed decisions about scheduling and other work-related factors to ensure their employees get adequate rest and are mentally and physically fit.

- **Mental Health Focus**: By considering sleep patterns and self-reported tiredness, SleepAdvisory aims to shed light on the mental health of employees. Identifying early signs of stress or sleep detriment can lead to timely interventions, reducing the risk of more severe mental health issues.

## How we built it
SleepAdvisory is a result of the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team of AI experts, software developers, and healthcare professionals. The key components of its development include:

- **Facial Recognition Technology**: We harnessed the power of OpenCV and DLib to create a robust facial recognition system capable of detecting signs of fatigue with exceptional accuracy.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Our AI algorithms leverage machine learning models to analyze user input data, identifying patterns that indicate whether fatigue is sleep-related or work-related.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: SleepAdvisory features an intuitive user interface that allows employees to input their data easily. The software then seamlessly uploads and analyzes this information.

- **Employer Dashboard**: We developed a secure dashboard for employers to access and interpret the data generated by SleepAdvisory, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing SleepAdvisory presented various technical and ethical challenges. Facial recognition required fine-tuning to ensure both accuracy and privacy. Handling sensitive data responsibly was paramount, necessitating robust security measures. Additionally, striking a balance between user privacy and data sharing was a complex issue we had to address.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
SleepAdvisory is a testament to what is achievable when technology, healthcare, and social responsibility converge. We are proud of several accomplishments:

- Developing a facial recognition system that can accurately detect fatigue.
- Creating a platform that respects user privacy while providing actionable insights to employers.
- Fostering a culture of well-being and mental health awareness in traditionally demanding industries.

## What we learned
The development of SleepAdvisory taught us the power of AI and technology in addressing real-world challenges. It reinforced the importance of ethical considerations and the responsibility that comes with handling sensitive data. Furthermore, it highlighted the potential for technological innovation to enhance employee well-being.

## What's next for SleepAdvisory
The journey of SleepAdvisory is just beginning. We aim to refine and expand our technology, making it even more accurate in assessing fatigue and related factors. We also plan to collaborate with more industries to promote a culture of well-being. Ultimately, we hope SleepAdvisory will lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction for workers in labor-intensive fields, and pave the way for safer, more efficient workplaces.
